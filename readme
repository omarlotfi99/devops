Install Java Development Kit (JDK) 8 or later.

Install Apache Maven. This is a build automation tool that will help you manage dependencies and build your project.

Clone or download the source code for the Spring Boot Service.

Navigate to the root directory of the project and run mvn clean install to build the project and run all tests. This will generate a target directory containing the compiled code and any other necessary artifacts.

Run the application by executing java -jar target/<service-name>.jar. Replace <service-name> with the name of the service you are building.

By default, the service will run on port 8080. You can access the service by navigating to http://localhost:8080 in your web browser.

You can test the service by using a REST client like Postman or cURL to send requests to the endpoints exposed by the service.

The Spring Boot Service includes a number of features and libraries to help you build a robust and scalable web service. These include:

Spring Web: Provides a set of features for building web applications, including RESTful web services.

Spring Data JPA: Provides a set of features for working with databases, including object-relational mapping (ORM) and automatic CRUD operations.

Spring Security: Provides a set of features for securing web applications, including authentication and authorization.

Spring Actuator: Provides a set of features for monitoring and managing the service in production.

For more information on how to use these features and libraries, please refer to the Spring Boot documentation.

Happy coding!
